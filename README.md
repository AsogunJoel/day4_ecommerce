A few resources to know before starting is:

The product provider makes use of the standard way you would make api calls. every other implemetation is for learning purposes and typically should'nt be used especially for production applications.  
- The vendor profile screen for the application has not been merged, but every other feature should be working fine.  
- If you find any updated you would want to make feel free to leave comments.
